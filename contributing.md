#Contributing to an OPEN Open Source project repository

This is an [OPEN Open Source](http://openopensource.org/) hardware project. Please fork it and work in your own copy, and file pull requests back to the master branch. 


## What?

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. **significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing style.

## Releases

Stick to semver: Major.Minor.Patch.

## Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add or change.
